## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.

* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [x] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for filtering Todods
* [X] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [X] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds
